# N-Puzzle
An **Artificial Intelligence** university work that focus on the study and implementation of search algorithms and their appliance in the famous N-Puzzle game.

Providing the initial and final state (game board) of an N-Puzzle game you'll be able to test the following search strategies performance:
1. A*
2. Greedy
3. DFS
4. BFS
5. IDFS


<h2> Dependencies </h2>
Your C++ compiler should support **C++11**.
If you're using a debian distro and anything wrong happens in the compilation process try to run this commands to update your system:

`$ sudo apt-get update` 


<h2> Usage </h2>
1. From the project source directory, run `$ make` to compile the program.
2. Run `$ ./N-Puzzle {board-size}` to execute. If not specified, the default board size (side length) is 4.
3. (optional) After using the program, you can run `$ make clean` to remove all the executables and object files.
